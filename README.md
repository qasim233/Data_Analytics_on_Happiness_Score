d. Displayed the mean Happiness Score of the countries grouped by the Region for any year.

g. Combined the datasets from 2015-2019 to construct 1 dataframe that contains the following columns. Country, Year (coming from the respective dataset) and Happiness Score for each year as a new column.
h. For any 2 countries draw a line chart (x-axis contains the years from the dataframe constructed in part g and y-axis contains the Happiness Score values for the respective years). Identify the trend.
i. For the year 2015, identify the regions that have an Economy (GDP per Capita) value less than 0.5.
j. Identify which 2 variables have the highest correlations across all the countries for the years 2015

  All tasks are done using python libraries "pandas", "numpy", "matplotlib.pyplot".
